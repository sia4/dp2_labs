Assignment 1a

General decisions:
Policies are nffgs' child elements because in this way it's easier to verify the key reference to a node directly through the schema and is not necessary to do it in the application.
I decided to use elements for data and attributes for meta-data, so I used elements for nffg-specific elements, such as nodes and links, and attributes for features related to them.
The traversed function of a policy is a child element and not an attribute because it can have more than one value. 
I tried to keep it as simple as possible, so I avoided to create too many sub elements and used attributes instead.

DTD:
- The name of nffgs and policies are of "ID" type, so they are unique in the xml file.
- I didn't create nodes and links of "ID" type because their names are not unique unless you consider a single nffg.

XML:
- NameType is used in order to have alphanumeric names starting with a letter.
- Names are unique for nodes and links in a specific nffg.
- In the application is important to control if a policy is traversal and in that case to check if it has at least a trasversal function defined.
